This is a repo of my projects I do for learning ML/AI - and also getting a good feel of writing python scripts.

As you can see there is till now 3 Folders:

1 - Automations :: this is for simple local scripts you can run to automate simple task on your machine.

2 - Data_Analysis :: this is for practicing my Data_Analysis skills and know more about it.

3 - Games :: just read the folder name :>

4 - Stuff_that_is_being_used :: simply for things i need to run some scripts or data sets.
