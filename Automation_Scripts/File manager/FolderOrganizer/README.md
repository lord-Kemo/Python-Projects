## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

This app allows users to enter an **absolute folder path**, then organizes all files inside that folder into appropriate subfolders based on file extensions. It handles common file types like documents, images, videos, audio, code files, and more.  

The interface features:  
- A clear message greeting the user  
- A large input box to enter the folder path  
- An "Organize" button to start sorting files  
- A log area showing real-time status and error messages
